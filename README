==========================

This modules allows you to recreate the workings of the cryptographic
cipher invented several hundred years ago by a French cryptographer,
Blaise de Vigenère.

and will return an undefined object if any other characters are entered.
The module also only encrypts/decrypts alpha characters, any other 
characters will be stripped out of the resulting encrption/decryption.
